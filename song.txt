Poets of the Fall - Carnival of Rust
To breathe the name
Of your savior
In your hour of need
And taste the blame
If the flavor should remind you of greed
Of implication, insinuation and you will
Till you cannot lie still
In all this turmoil, before red cave and foil
Come closing in for a kill
Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah feed the rain
'Cause without your love, my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust
It's all a game
Avoiding failure
When true colors will bleed
All in the name
Of misbehavior
And the things we don't need
